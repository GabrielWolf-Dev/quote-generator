## Overview

![screenshot](https://quote-generator-gwdev.vercel.app/assets/img/screenshot.png)

One of the first projects where I'm applying my knowledge of Vue.js, which is the current framework in my learning to find a job, in it I applied the most recent version (Vue 3) with JavaScript Vanilla, without TypeScript that will be next topic that I will learn after the end of this project.
<br />
Initially I thought that I would not be able to apply much knowledge about Vue.js, but by studying the API documentation and the emergence of new features beyond the standard required by figma, I was able to apply more advanced knowledge that I had a lot of benefit from and I could better understand the tools that Vue makes available to the developer. Some things I had a lot of difficulty solving the problem, it was challenging but very rewarding to develop this project. It will even serve very well to consult something that I may forget in the future in other projects.
<br />
In addition to the basic concepts of Vue, due to having studied Vue 2, I had to dig deeper into some things in the documentation that changed between version 2 and 3, this being the main challenge that I liked to gain experience to be able to discern some differences between versions.
